# Object-Detection-Using-TensorFlow
This project demonstrates object detection with TensorFlow, using pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub. It loads datasets, preprocesses images, applies detection models, and visualizes results with bounding boxes, showcasing end-to-end deep learning for computer vision tasks.

ðŸš€ Features

Uses TensorFlow Hub pre-trained models (e.g., SSD, Faster R-CNN).
Loads and preprocesses images for inference.
Runs object detection to identify multiple objects in an image.
Visualizes predictions with bounding boxes and labels using PIL & Matplotlib.
End-to-end pipeline: load image â†’ detect objects â†’ show results.

Results --->

Successfully detects multiple objects per image.
Output is bounding boxes with confidence scores.
I am showing if it is able to detect digits within the bounding boxes.
But it also can ...
Sample Scenario ->
Input: street image with cars and people.
Output: detected cars, pedestrians, traffic lights with bounding boxes.
